Each country is treated as one node with country-specific hourly time series of electricity demand and renewable feed-in. The country-specific wind and photovoltaic feed-in is characterised by the installed capacity and an hourly capacity factor. The capacity factors are calculated with the help of publically available time series of wind speed and solar radiation. ELTRAMOD is a linear optimisation model which calculates the cost-minimal generation dispatch and investments in additional transmission lines, storage facilities and other flexibility options. The set of conventional power plants consists of fossil fired, nuclear and hydro plants where different technological characteristics are implemented, such as efficiency, emission factors and availability. Daily prices for CO2 allowances, as well as daily wholesale fuel prices supplemented by country-specific mark-ups are implemented in ELTRAMOD. The country- and technology-specific parameters and the temporal resolution of 8760 hours allow an in-depth analysis of various challenges of the future European electricity system.

The EPS allows the user to control dozens of different policies that affect energy use and emissions in various sectors of the economy (such as a carbon tax, fuel economy standards for vehicles, reducing methane leakage from industry, and accelerated R&D advancement of various technologies). The model includes every major sector of the economy: transportation, electricity supply, buildings, industry, agriculture, and land use. The model reports outputs at annual intervals and provides numerous outputs, including: ->Emissions of 12 different pollutants (CO2, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and eight others), as well as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e; a measure of the global warming potential of various pollutants). ->Direct cash flow (cost or savings) impacts on consumers, industry (as a whole), government, and several specific industries ->Human deaths avoided thanks to reduced particulate pollution The composition and output of the electricity sector (e.g. capacity and generation from coal, natural gas, wind, solar, etc.) ->Vehicle technology market shares and fleet composition (electric vehicles, etc.) ->Energy use by fuel type from various energy-using technologies (specific types of vehicles, building components, etc.) ->Breakdowns of how each policy within a policy package contributes to total abatement and the cost-effectiveness of each policy (e.g. wedge diagrams and cost curves) The EPS is a system dynamics computer model created in a commercial program called Vensim. Vensim is a tool produced by Ventana Systems for the creation and simulation of system dynamics models. The Energy Policy Simulator has been designed to be used with the free Vensim Model Reader. Directions on how to obtain Vensim Model Reader and the Energy Policy Simulator can be found on the Download and Installation Instructions page. The model is distributed with a complete set of input data representing the United States, but it has a modular structure that allows it to be adapted to different countries and regions by swapping the input data. The EPS reads in all of its input data from external text files, which are generated by accompanying Excel files. All of these files are included in the model distribution. Additional Information The EPS is released under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3) or any later version and is free and open-source software.

In its basic version, the model includes the EU-28 countries as well as Switzerland, Norway, the Baltic States and the Balkan region. In addition, important suppliers for the European natural gas market are considered (e.g. Russia, Algeria, and Qatar). On the supply side, the model considers different production capacities with respect to the production level. The model enables the transport of natural gas by modelling pipelines and liquefied natural gas (LNG) shipping. The capacity of single pipelines between neighbouring countries are aggregated in the model. In the case of LNG shipping, the model considers regasification and liquefaction capacities in export and import countries. The model includes an exogenously imputed natural gas demand for each respective country. Moreover, seasonal demand patterns in the respective countries are considered. GAMAMOD enables the analysis of trading capacities between regional markets. Due to restricted transmission capacities, regional incidences of congestions might occur. The model allows for examining supply interruptions and their impact on the European natural gas system. As each country is modelled as a single aggregated node, no congestions occur within a market area. Furthermore, the model considers natural gas storage, which ensures security of supply in the European natural gas market. Cyprus and Malta are isolated from the integrated European natural gas pipeline grid. Therefore, they are not considered in the model.ore, they are not considered in the model.",,https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/ee2/forschung/modelle/gamamod?set_language=en +,,https://wiki.openmod-initiative.org/wiki/GAMAMOD,Philipp Hauser +,,,transmission + and distribution +,

It captures endogenous substitution between fuels, infrastructure constraints and endogenous investment (e.g., pipeline capacity, power generation technologies), as well as market power by producers of fossil fuels in a unified framework. The mathematical framework of the MultiMod model is a dynamic Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) derived from individual players' profit maximisation problems. The formulation is generic and flexible, so that the supply chain of any number of fossil and renewable fuels can be modelled. The framework includes seasonality and allows for a detailed infrastructure representation and a comprehensive transformation sector. Investment in infrastructure (transportation, seasonal storage, transformation) is determined endogenously in the model according to the respective player’s inter-temporal optimisation problem. Furthermore, substitution between different energy carriers on the final demand side is endogenous. Modelling co-production of fuels (e.g. crude oil and associated gas) is possible, as well as a flexible setup of transformation units (multiple inputs, multiple outputs). By formulating the model as an equilibrium problem derived from non-cooperative game theory, the model can incorporate Cournot market power by individual suppliers as well as distinct discount rates by various players concerning their investment. The current framework is an open-loop perfect foresight model. A stochastic version of the model is under development at NTNU Trondheim. This will allow for consideration of uncertainty and distinct risk profiles for individual players along the supply chain, including investment by consumers in energy efficiency. For the model description paper, a database representing the global energy system was compiled and used for scenario analysis (Huppmann & Egging, 2014). New datasets or variations on the initial data base are currently under development within specific research projects: - Focus on US domestic conventional crude and shale oil infrastructure (lead: Johns Hopkins University) - Focus on Chinese coal policies (lead: Tsinghua University) - Focus on the global crude oil market and refinery investment (lead: DIW Berlin/TU Berlin) The model is formulated and solved as a Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) and implemented in GAMS, using MS Access and MS Excel for data processing and output reports.

""Generic"" in this context refers to a ""generally valid"" building model. This means that the software is versatile enough to simulate any type of building in a very flexible and simplified way, enabling users to efficiently adapt the software for any building design. GenSim was specifically devloped for the use during project pre-planning where detailed simulations of buildings are challenging due to typically constrained time budgets and limited availability of information. Traditional simulation tools require extensive input data, making the process time-consuming. GenSim addresses this by providing presets for multiple building typologies and a streamlined approach for quick, simple, yet accurate building simulations. This is particularly valuable in early planning stages when only rough data about the planned buildings is available. If more detailed information (wall structure, detailed geometry, specific use, ...) is available about the building to be examined, this can be used for more precise results.

This approach enables detailed simulations without linearization, capturing energy flow and system state in each time step. The central mathematical model is based on energy balances and the order of the energy calculations that is determined during preprocessing. In addition, ReSiE is suitable to perform black-box optimizations for optimal component sizing.

The model offers an underlying database, which contains load shifting potentials on the administrative district level for Germany. The load shifting potentials are calculated by taking into account the structural parameters of the respective regions, such as employment rates in different industry sectors or the composition of the residential building stock. The local flexibility demand data of the power grid are calculated using the open_eGO energy system model. In region4FLEX, a cost optimisation defines, which of the available load shifting potentials in a region can be used, to meet the local flexibility demand. The resulting operating data, e.g. numbers of load shifting events, are used for a subsequent economic-assessment of the flexibility options from the operator’s perspective.

TIMES_PT model informed climate policy in Portugal in the last 10 years and has supported the design of climate mitigation policies. The development of the TIMES_PT model started within the EU research project NEEDS and the national research project E2POL. Although its implementation was motivated by research goals, during the past decade the model has become a major tool supporting national climate mitigation policies, and to a lesser extent, air pollution policies. The Low Carbon Roadmap 2050 is a flagship policy document currently used as the Portuguese long term view on mitigation goals, while the PNAC— National Plan on Climate Change includes the visions up to 2030 from stakeholders from other policy areas, as transportation and industry. The negotiations for the revisions of the National Emission Ceilings Directive for 2020 and 2030, as well as the National Strategy for Air Quality (2015) were supported by projections generated by TIMES_PT.
